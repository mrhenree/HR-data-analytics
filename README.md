# HR-data-analytics
This project was about creating dashboards/report that provide very useful insights on 'employee attendance' in a particular firm (name withheld) in order to help the HR department better evaluate and track employee commitment and aslo make data-driven decisions.
To do this, I imported the excel file to PowerBI where I carried out the data cleaning process. After this, I created several metrics to further help analyze the data, track employee commitment, understand employee wellbeing, improve efficiency, and also make data-driven decisions in the firm.
